These are release notes for New Relic Nozzle for Pivotal Platform.

## <a id="ver-2.5.3"></a> v2.5.3

**General Availability Release Date:** Feb 29, 2020

Features included in this release:

* Fixed race condition when multiple metrics were created at the same time.

## <a id="ver-2.5.2"></a> v2.5.2

**General Availability Release Date:** Jan 31, 2020

Features included in this release:

* PCFCapacity events will no longer continue to report data for Diego cells that no longer exist.

## <a id="ver-2.5.0"></a> v2.5.0

**General Availability Release Date:** Jan 27, 2020

Features included in this release:

* Nozzle now communicates with Loggregator using the Reverse Log Proxy (RLP) Gateway and V2 envelope format. This ensures support with PCF 2.9.
* Events are now routed to multiple event types (`PCFContainerMetric`, `PCFLogMessage`, etc.) instead of all events using `PcfFirehoseEvent`. **This requires alert and dashboard adjustments.**
* Event attribute names have changed from camel case to using `.` to separate multiple words.  For example, `app.name`, `metric.max`, etc. **This requires alert and dashboard adjustments.**
* Metric based events (`PCFContainerMetric`, `PCFCounterEvent`, and `PCFValueMetric`) are now aggregated. This reduces the number of events produced by the nozzle.  Added attributes include `metric.min`, `metric.max`, `metric.sample`.`last.value`, `metric.samples.count`, and `metric.sum`.
* Added `PCFCapacity` event type.
* Added caching and rate limiting for PCF API calls.
* Some configuration variables have changed names. **May require tile configuration updates.**
* Added LogMessage include/exclude filters.
* Application related events (`PCFContainerMetric` and `PCFLogMessage`) can now be routed to a different New Relic account if a New Relic RPM Account ID and Insights Insert Key are defined in New Relic Service Broker plan configuration.
* Metric related filters have been removed due to the event reduction benefits of aggregation.
* Added graceful shutdown in response to cf restart, stop, or scale down scenarios.
