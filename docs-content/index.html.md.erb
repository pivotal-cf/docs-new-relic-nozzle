<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING! </strong>
The first version of New Relic Nozzle for PCF was in private beta internally by New Relic and by a select number of customers before it was registered on PivNet. The product is currently in public beta and is intended for evaluation and testing purposes until further notice.
</p>

<br/>
This documentation describes [New Relic Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/nr-firehose-nozzle/). New Relic Nozzle for PCF collects metrics and events that are generated by all PCF components and applications which are running on PCF Diego cells by [loggregator](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/index.html), and pushes this data to [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com) to be ingested by New Relic Insights for dashboarding and visualization.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

<p>Once New Relic Nozzle for PCF is installed in a PCF domain, it starts collecting and pushing Firehose events to New Relic Insights for visualiztion. New Relic organizes the Firehose data based on Firehose event types, and shows each Firehose event type in its own separate dashboard.</p>

<p>The nozzle could be installed as a tile in Ops Mgr, or it could be deployed using the CLI command **"cf push"** as a regular application. You can then monitor the health and performance of your PCF deployments, and set alerts based on any metrics that is collected from PCF Firehose.</p>




## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

The nozzle dashboards that allow you to visualize the Firehose metrics and events are highly dynamic in that they are filterable by many metrics and categories.

You could monitor the health and performance of PCF components by following categories:

    * PCF Domain
    * PCF Deployment
    * Firehose Event Type
    * Origin
    * Job
    * Component IP Address
    * Application ID
    * Container

Just select the item from a list of values for any of the above metrics, and filter the dashboard based on the selected value. You can filter a dashboard by multiple metrics.
